- [Neural Point Process for Learning Spatiotemporal Event Dynamics](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v168/zhou22a/zhou22a.pdf) How to incorporate neural point process into the MOT framework?

- [Lyapunov Density Models: Constraining Distribution Shift in Learning-Based Control](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/ldm/) [Sergey's Explanation](https://twitter.com/svlevine/status/1539663710976737280?s=20&t=ORvr13Z1HaHY0L6zGf1kMQ) Use Lyapunov like function to certify the distribution shift.

- [Nocturne: a scalable driving benchmark for bringing multi-agent learning one step closer to the real world](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09889) This might be a simulator that I can use for the experiments.

- There are two ways to incorporate contingency planning into MPC based planning. One, MPC can be [multi-model and branched](http://ames.caltech.edu/chen2021interactive.pdf). Two, Multi-Hypothesis Tracking and Multi-Scenario MPC based Planning. Not that many people are aware of the MHT issue, so that is another way to use multi-scenario MPC based planning.
